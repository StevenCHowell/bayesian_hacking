# Bayesian Hacking with Python

## Brief Description
What is the probability of correctly answering a Baye's theorem problem given you have not reviewed statistics in years?  See an example of solving a Baye's theorem problem by actually simulating the system, while visualizing the system converging via a live streamed plot.

## Detailed Abstract
Statistics can often be unintuitive. With computers, we have a simple means to simulate complex situations and systems. In this talk, I will demonstrate how you can use hacking skills to simulate real systems representing tricky Bayesian statistics problem. You will see how you can visualize the simulation convergence and compare the result via a live streamed plot of the results.
